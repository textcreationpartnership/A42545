            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

We have all of us ſome corruption to be ſnuffed, ſome breaches to be repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb facs="tcp:34714:3"/> ſome ſpots to be cleanſed. What? though a man hath led his life unblameably before men, that none can tax him with any wrong or indirectneſſe at all, yet may he not therefore think that he is innocent in the ſight of God: For notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, his own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will frame an undeniable Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſm, proving him to come within the reach of the curſe of ſin: the <hi>Major</hi> Propoſition is taken out of <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.26. <hi>Curſed is he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth not all the words of this Law to do them,</hi> or that fulfilleth not the whole Law: Every mans conſcience will frame the <hi>Minor;</hi> and tell him, that he hath not fulfilled the whole Law: The concluſion follows, therefore he is under the curſe: Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans conſcience (I ſay) doth conclude <hi>ex lege Dei,</hi> out of the Law of God, which doth condemn us for ſin, and makes us like <hi>Adam,</hi> to run away from the preſence of God; for fear of his wrath and
<pb facs="tcp:34714:4"/> heavy diſpleaſure: but every faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſoul hath his conſolation in the Goſpel, and in the great Mediator Chriſt Jeſus, whom God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to ſtand in the gap between Heaven and Earth, and make up the breach, to reconcile both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, upon whom man may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge all his ſins, and God diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge all his anger, who like a ſtrong and impregnable wall, keeps our ſins from approaching to God, and Gods vengeance from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to us: He came into the world for our good, to ſeek and to ſave us that were loſt, he came from Heaven by accepting of humane nature,<note place="margin">Venit enim fi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lius hom nis de Caelo in mundum, per humanitatis aſſumptionem quaerere per doctrinam ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, ſalvum fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere per gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam quod perierat per culpam.</note> he came to ſeek by his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, to ſave by his grace, thoſe who had periſhed through ſin: He came to call us, and never came there ſuch a ſuitor as he is: he comes, he ſeeks, he cals, he omits no means, (being come) to draw us to himſelf; by him we have immediate acceſſe to the Lord, and are imboldened to
<pb facs="tcp:34714:4"/> ſpeak to him as it were face to face, and mouth to mouth: It were then too ſhameleſſe and ſenſleſſe a part to make uſe of other means to come to the heavenly Majeſty. Surely they do much injury to his grace, who talk of Warders and Porters, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Saints, to be ſolicited to admit us into the preſence of God; and to bring us to ſpeak with him: ſervices not unmeet for the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the earth, whoſe perſons have need of guardance and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for the ſafeguard of their lives, upon whoſe life the life of the Countrey, and their people with whom they live, doth depend: they have need of ſpecial regard and guard to their bodies, or they may ſoon fall into danger. Beſides, it is true of Princes of this world, what <hi>Jethro</hi> told <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he ſate from morning to evening to hear the cauſes of the people, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18. <hi>Thou both wearieſt thy ſelf, and the people that is with thee, the thing
<pb facs="tcp:34714:5"/> is too heavy for thee, and thou canſt not do it thy ſelf alone.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore infinite ſuits, beſides the diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of many other buſineſſes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring larger audience than the ears of any mortal man can afford, drive them of neceſſity to the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſubordinate Officers, both to admit and receive, the coming and requeſts of their inferiours: but there is neither danger in the perſon of God, who rideth upon the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and maketh his enemies to periſh, like as the ſmoak vaniſheth away, or as wax melteth at the fire: neither is his throne to be approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto after the ſame manner. It was the danger of <hi>Heſters</hi> life to come before King <hi>Ahaſucrus,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſhe were called for, the Law being thus, <hi>That whatſoever man or woman came into the inner Court, which was not called, ſhould die, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the King held forth his golden Scepter:</hi> But the Scepter of our Lord, the great King of Heaven
<pb facs="tcp:34714:5"/> and Earth, I mean the golden Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter of his grace, is ever held out to man, woman, child, bond and free, ſtranger or Citizen, whether called or not called: they may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly approach (I name neither out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward nor inner Court) but even to the throne where the King himſelf ſitteth.</p>
            <p>And as there is no danger in his perſon, ſo no defect in his hearing, whoſe ears are open to the prayers of the poor deſtitute, whoſe eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids ſoundly try and examine the children of men. He that boweth the Heavens, and comes down with his all-diſcerning knowledge, hath he need of intelligencers to inform him of earthly things? He that <hi>planted the ear, doth he not hear?</hi> He that knocketh at our doors, and calleth for entrance, when we ſtand and knock at his; will he not grant us entrance? Surely he is nigh to all that <hi>call upon him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 145.18.</note> 
               <hi>to all that call upon him in truth.</hi> To encline his
<pb facs="tcp:34714:6"/> ear to our prayers is to accept them, and caſt a gracious eye upon them, and ſo to inflame the hearts of his people, that with faith and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence they may pray unto him, and prevail with him. If a King ſhew a cheerfull countenance to a poor man, that deſireth to ſpeak unto him, and turneth his eyes towards him, ſhewing himſelf attentive to his words, will not this poor man rejoyce? Will not the Kings coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and attention ſerve as a ſpeech to him, and be as much as words, and a great grace unto him? ſo in like manner we underſtand God to encline his ear to our prayers, when he granteth to us fervour of ſpirit in praying to him.</p>
            <p>But hath God ears? Is he a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſaith a devout man? Far be it from us ſo to think, for even a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is by many degrees more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than a body:<note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:34714:6"/> by the ear we underſtand thoſe things that are ſpoken to us, but God hath known from everlaſting what ever men have either thought or ſpoken: Surely Gods ear to us doth inſinuate ſomewhat elſe that cannot be underſtood of his ſimple knowledge; for to ſome he doth encline his ear, to others he turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth away his ear, but his knowledg is ever the ſame: what then is meant by his ear? Surely his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of approbation or rejection. He enclineth his ear, and heareth the prayers of the righteous, becauſe they pleaſe him, and are approved of him. He turneth away his ear from the prayers of the wicked, becauſe they diſpleaſe him, and becauſe he rejecteth them. Should I now give you the picture of a true ſupplicant, I ſhould humbly crave leave to tell you; He is one whoſe breſt is ſore with the ſtroak of his own pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent hands, which are alwayes ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like <hi>Moſes</hi> upon the Mount lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="tcp:34714:7"/> up towards Heaven; or the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans</hi> in the Temple ſmiting his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome: His knees are hardned with conſtant praying, his voice hoarce with crying and calling to Heaven, and when he cannot ſpeak, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers his mind in ſighs and groans: There's not a tear fals from him, but an Angel ſtands with a bottle to catch it; he thinks every mans ſins leſſe than his own, every mans good deeds more: He deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not only men, but even beaſts and trees to mourn with him: mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy comes down like a glorious <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rub,</hi> and lights upon his boſome, with this meſſage from God, <hi>I have heard thy prayers and ſeen thy tears,</hi> and ſo with a handkerchief of comfort dries his cheeks, and ſaith to him in the words of the Wiſe-man, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.7. <hi>Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart, for God now accepteth thy works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us then acquaint our ſelves
<pb facs="tcp:34714:7"/> with God, and walk with him as his friends, then may we come with boldneſſe to the throne of grace: it is accounted a great matter to have recourſe to the chamber of preſence, but to go into the holy of holies, to commune with God, and daily to preſent our ſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, is a moſt ſingular prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative: And although hypocrites may draw neer to God outwardly, and honour him with their lips, and ſeem to be fearleſſe of Gods wrath; yet their ſecurity is but like that of <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> which as ſoon as God awakeneth their conſciences, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh deſperate trembling: but when the heart is ſprinkled from an evil conſcience, and the body waſht with pure water, then doth a man draw neer to God with a true heart, in full aſſurance of faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22.</p>

The Hebrew Doctors ſpeak of four Keys that God keeps in his power, which he will not give to any Angel: 1. The Key of Rain: thus he promiſeth to <hi>open the Heavens, to give rain in due ſeaſon,</hi> Deut. 20.12. 2. The Key of food: thus he is ſaid, <hi>To open his hand, and fill his people with good,</hi> Pſal. 104.28. 3. The Key of the grave: <hi>Behold, O my people, I will open your graves,</hi> Ezek. 37.12. 4. The Key of the womb: thus he is ſaid
<pb facs="tcp:34714:8"/> to <hi>open the womb of Kachel,</hi> Gen. 30.22. But the Scripture tells us, that God hath many other Keys alſo: He hath the Key of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and the Key of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: He is ſaid therefore firſt to open the Scriptures to the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.32. and then to open their underſtandings. He hath like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Key of the heart: thus God opened the heart of <hi>Lydia</hi> to conceive well: The ears of the Prophet to hear well, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.5. The eyes of <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s ſervant to ſee well, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6.17. And the lips of <hi>David</hi> to ſpeak well, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.15. Here you have another Key, which the Ancients call <hi>Clavem Coeli,</hi> the Key of Heaven, becauſe it opens the gate of Heaven to us, and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuam Paradiſi,</hi> the gate of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, becauſe it letteth men in to God, and bringeth them with their requeſts into his preſence: There is no Lock but this Key will open, and Chriſt in whom are

               <p>There is a twofold vocation on Gods part, and a twofold diſquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or ſeeking on our part. 1. There is an externall, generall, or common vocation, when God offereth us the means, which doth not alway take effect: ſo, <hi>many are called, but few are choſen,</hi> Matth. 20.16. 2. The other is an internall, ſpeciall, and peculiar vocation, when Gods bleſſing doth accompany thoſe means, which can not be without taking effect: for thoſe <hi>whom he calleth, he juſtifieth, and whom he juſtifieth he alſo glorifieth, Rom.</hi> 8.30.

                  </gap>ar enclineth to us, as our heart
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:34714:160"/> enclineth to him, and if we decline from him, and encline to wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with our hearts, we move him to decline from us, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to wrath; why ſhould God lend any man his ears, that regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not him in his heart? ſuch may expect to be anſwered, as God anſwered the <hi>Jewes,</hi> Iſai. 1.15. <hi>When ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you; yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear;</hi> the reaſon followeth, <hi>becauſe your hands are full of bloud:</hi> none can pray aright, but ſuch as are endued with the Spirit of God, to direct them how to form and frame their prayers, that they may have acceſs to God, and acceptance in Gods Court of audience; but this none but the godly and regenerate have; therefore only ſuch can pray aright, and as they ought.</p>
               <p>Object. 1. <hi>But we read in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that the wicked do ſometimes pray unto God: they are ſaid to cry to God, and call upon him,</hi> Job 27.9, 10. Prov. 1.28.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> 1. Such prayers are not
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:34714:160"/> true prayers, they are but lip-devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, drawing nigh to God with their mouths, and honouring him with their lips, when their hearts are farre from him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.8. they are like inſtruments, and bells out of tune, that make much noiſe, but there is no melody at all. 2. They are but the expreſſions of their own private ſpirits, and not the fruits of Gods Spirit in them. 3. There is nothing but fleſh in their prayers, they are bad trees, and cannot bring forth good fruit. 4. They are but a ſhadow of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, therefore the Lord regardeth them not, he counteth their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers but as the howling of beaſts, and not as the voice of his Spirit, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.14. becauſe when they had ſpent a whole day in prayer and faſting, yet the Lord counted it as not done to him, becauſe their heart was not towards God nor the good duty, but like brute beaſts they how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for corn and wine.</p>
               <p>Object. 2. <hi>But wicked men may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive many excellent forms of prayer, and ſhew much zeal,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="294" facs="tcp:34714:161"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> Prayer ſtandeth not in the copy of words, nor noiſe of the voice, but in the holy deſire and diſpoſition of the heart: they have often burning lips, the words of prayer, yet pray they do not; they want thoſe ſighs and groans of the ſpirit, which the Spirit of God worketh in the hearts of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: its the voice of the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate part, animated, informed, and quickned by Gods Spirit, that God heareth, and knoweth the meaning of, that God accepteth, and rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth: hypocrites have the wood and frankinſcence, but they want fire to cauſe heat, and a ſweet ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, their prayers are dead and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 3. It may be further ſaid, <hi>That God heareth the wicked ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and granteth their requeſts: thus God heard the voice of</hi> Hagar <hi>and</hi> Iſhmael, <hi>when they were ready to periſh for thirſt, and opened the eyes of</hi> Hagar <hi>to ſee a well of water,</hi> Gen. 21.17. <hi>When King</hi> Rehoboam <hi>had eſtabliſht the Kingdome and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned himſelf and forſook the Law of
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:34714:161"/> the Lord his God: the Lord ſtirred up</hi> Shiſhak <hi>King of</hi> Aegypt <hi>againſt him who took their fenced Cities, whereupon the King and Princes of</hi> Iſrael <hi>humbled themſelves, and the Lord granted them ſome deliverance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> 1. I anſwer, That whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God granteth the requeſts of wicked men; its not for their ſakes, but for the promiſe that he hath made to his own ordinance, and to commend that: <hi>Item,</hi> we ſhall ſtill obſerve, that they be temporall bleſſings and no other, that they obtain, that he beſtoweth upon them, as we may ſee in <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.29. who when he heard the words of the Prophet denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt his houſe; he humbled himſelf before the Lord, therefore brought not the evill threatned in his daies, but in his ſonnes daies: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>s for theſe outward bleſſings, God many times beſtoweth them upon wicked men; thus he gave <hi>Aegypt</hi>

               <p>Therefore there muſt be in him that prayeth, an earneſt deſire to forſake all ſinnes: prayer is a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice whereby we labour to appeaſe Gods wrath conceived againſt us for our ſinnes, now if we do this with a purpoſe to continue in our ſinnes, we cauſe God with indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to reject our prayers.

The Ruler of the Synagogue believed, that if Chriſt came and laid his hands upon his daughter, ſhe ſhould be healed. The woman with the bloudy iſſue believed, that if ſhe might but touch the hemme of his garment ſhe ſhould be healed.

IF we will pray ſo that we may be heard, we muſt pray with zeal and fervency; a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſuitor cannot but have audience when he ſpeaks unto his God, and when at any time our prayers want ſucceſſe, the defect is in our ſelves. Gods anſwer is according to the vigour of our prayers, if the cryes we ſend up come not from the very fervency of the heart, they ſound not in the ears of God: <hi>The prayer of the righteous man availeth much, if it be fervent,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>James;</hi> elſe even the prayers of the juſt, if they be perfunctory and cold, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of cuſtome, than of devotion and piety, they avail not but to condemnation, they procure us not audience from God, but rather ſhall be anſwered by God as the prayers of thoſe Idolaters in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8. <hi>Though they cry in mine ear with a loud voice, I will not hear them, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Whereas many times we find that an earneſt ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:34714:169"/> with the heart hath prevailed without any words uttered by the tongue: <hi>He that heareth without ears can interpret our prayers without tongues,</hi> and the voice of the one is not more audible to him than the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the other.</p>
                  <p>That all our prayers ought to be made with earneſtneſſe of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and enflamed with the fire of an ardent zeal, the Scripture ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us by the ſeveral termes by which fervent prayer is ſet forth unto us: ſometimes it is called <hi>a crying unto God,</hi> Exod. 14.15. Exod. 17.4. Jonah 2.2. a <hi>wreſtling with God,</hi> Gen. 32.24. compared with <hi>Hoſea</hi> 12.4. a <hi>ſtriving with God, Rom.</hi> 15.30 a <hi>taking hold of God, Iſai.</hi> 64.7. Prayer is typed by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe in the old Law, that gave no ſweet ſmell, till the fire came to it: ſo prayer is nothing without the fire of zeal, it maketh no ſweet ſavour before the Lord: And good Reaſon there is for it:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe all religious duties ought to be performed with our choiceſt and chiefeſt affections, <hi>Deut.</hi>
                     <pb n="311" facs="tcp:34714:169"/> 6.5. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.10. and therefore this of prayer which is a principal duty of Religion</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe in fervent prayer we pour out our hearts before the Lord, which God requireth, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.19.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This condemneth the ſimple practice of the Lay-Papiſts, who think that God regardeth their vain repeating over ſo many <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter noſters</hi> and <hi>Ave Maries,</hi> and other Latine prayers by their Beads, though they underſtood not what they ſay, nor reſpect how they runne them over, ſo they be ſaid, they care not how they be ſaid with how litttle devotion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This condemneth alſo the Opinion and Doctrine of their Clergy, who aſcribe vertue to their <hi>Opus operatum</hi> in prayer, and other good works.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It gives a check to the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſtupid lazineſſe of many amongſt us, who do ſo ſlightly, and ſo haſtily, and ſleepily ſlubber over this duty of prayer, both pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly and privately, without any
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:34714:170"/> manifeſtation of the leaſt meaſure of zeal and affection. Some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves (though they be in health) with two or three words careleſly, heartleſly, and fooliſhly bolted forth, while they lie in their beds between ſleeping and waking; ſome pray as they are a making themſelves ready or unready; ſome are ſo far from praying fervently that they pray not at all.</p>
                  <p>Therefore when we pray, let us pray fervently, for,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The thing that we pray for are of abſolute neceſſity, <hi>viz.</hi> the glory of God, the juſtification of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the ſanctification of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the ſalvation of our ſouls, therefore we muſt go about them, as about matter of life and death, and beg of God as a condemned per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for his life of his Judge.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He that prayes coldly, ſeems to be careleſſe whether he be heard or not, and teacheth God to deny him his requeſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thoſe that be dull in prayer will much more be dull in giving thanks: we ſhould therefore pray,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:34714:170"/> as thoſe that mean to ſpeed, and be ſo eager, as thoſe that will take no denial.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This is the reaſon why ſo many find ſo little comfort and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe in their daily prayers, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly want of zeal, they have not the anſwer of God upon their ſpirits, who pray without life and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: our zeal herein ſhould be like the fire that the veſtal Virgins kept in <hi>Rome,</hi> or rather like the ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing fire upon the Altar under the Law, that ever burnt, and never went out: <q>As loathing of meat and painfulneſſe of ſpeaking are two ſymptomes of a ſick body, ſo careleſneſſe of hearing, and irkſomneſſe of praying, are ſigns of a ſick and diſeaſed ſoul, ſaith a Learned man.</q>

IN all our prayers, let us expreſſe the grounds of them; and uſe ſuch reaſons unto God, as may moſt move him to grant our requeſts: not as though God needed any reaſons to inform him of our neceſſities, or to move him to ſupply them, for he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them better than our ſelves, and is more ready to help than we to ask, but he delighteth that his children ſhould plead with him in prayer: beſides this is an evidence of the graces of God in us.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Of our knowledge: an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant man is not able to plead his cauſe with another; this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a knowing Chriſtian, when he thus pleadeth with God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This is an evidence of our faith; he that pleads with God in prayer for any mercy, ſheweth that he is confident of an anſwer. Now herein the Lord taketh plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and therefore he will have us
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:34714:174"/> reaſon it out with him. Thus Chriſt dealt with the woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> Matth. 15.22,—28. as hath already been ſhewed. This is manifeſt likewiſe from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of prayer, which is called a ſtanding in the gap, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 22.30. a wreſtling with God, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 32.24. The ſtrong reaſons of faith doe much prevail with God, and this is one principal part of the efficacy of prayer, by which we prevail, and our ſupplications become effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, <hi>viz.</hi> in laying down ſuch ſtrong reaſons as may move God to grant our reque<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>. In prayer we put our caſe into Gods hand; you know if a man be wronged and oppreſſed among men, when he cometh to a Judge or an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate, that he thinketh will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake his buſineſſe, and do him right, will he not uſe many reaſons and arguments to him? Now when men apprehend that God is a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, both ready to hear, and able to help his people in time of need, this makes them cry migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:34714:175"/> to God. This advice <hi>Eliphaz</hi> gives to <hi>Job,</hi> Chap. 5.8. <hi>I would ſeek unto God, and to God commit my cauſe;</hi> True prayer is a putting our caſe to the Lord, and a plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him, and this requireth ſtrength of reaſon and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Now when we come to God, it is not enough to pray by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing our deſires; but we muſt pray enforcing and preſſing our deſires, backing them with good reaſons, ſuch as may make them warrantable and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, not ſuch as are made for vain reſpects, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.3. and to this purpoſe:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let us be thorowly ſenſible of the want of thoſe bleſſings we pray for; then ſhall we begge hard for them: if a beggar be ſtript of all, and have not a bit of bread, and be ready to ſtarve, how will he plead for ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Get ſpiritual ingenuity. Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms ſcholars are not fools; where true grace is, it will make
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:34714:175"/> the ſoul quick and ſagacious in holy reaſoning, as is evident in the woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> Matthew 15.27. It is Satan's language, as well as the Scripture's, to tell a Chriſtian, that he is the chief of ſinners; but even then may he argue from his condition, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did, 1 <hi>Timothy</hi> 1.15. <hi>I am the chief of ſinners,</hi> yet one whom Chriſt came into the world to ſave: Thou art one of the loſt ones, ſaith the Devil; Oh then ſay, Chriſt came to ſeek and ſave that which was loſt: his ſeeking denoteth his diligence, his ſaving denoteth his power, and [both] his love.</p>
                  <p>Yet let us not think or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that words and arguments of themſelves are powerfull with God; for if any man be heard, it is not for the ſweetneſſe of words, the variety of matter, the multiplicity of reaſons, but through the interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt, which maketh God propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to us, and to accept our
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:34714:176"/> poor and humble prayers: If therefore our prayers be heard, let us aſcribe it to God's dignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not to our dignity, to God's benignity, not to the Rhetorique or excellency of our prayer's; to to God's ear, and not to our tongue.</p>
                  <p>To conclude; let us be ſure, that when we are wide-mouthed to ask of God, we are not cloſe-fiſted to thoſe that ask of us: Many will ask much from God, and part with nothing to others; yea many will promiſe much, and performe little: But God is open-handed and open-hearted, his promiſes are performances, and his words are workes; he is truth, and cannot lie; vertue, and cannot faile, and his power is ſufficient to make good his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. Among men promiſes are often as empty as the winde; ſome would performe and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not; ſome can and will not: but God both can and will; his will is not larger than his
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:34714:176"/> power; but what God doth will that doth God work, and whatſoever God is able to will, he is able to work alſo.</p>
